                        <p>At the risk of sounding cliche, a lot can change in a year. At the risk of stating the obvious, a lot can change in a month, day, week, and so on. Given the inevitable change buried within the human condition, I've always found more value in appreciating the experiences I faced in the previous 12 months rather than crafting a "new me" from the dreams of what could be. In doing so, I feel that I enable myself to take with me the lessons I've learned through the last year while leaving behind the weight of the past.</p>
                        <p>In 2021, I encountered my fair share of highs and lows, much like everyone else. My husband and I bought a house, and I completed my master's degree and gained two publications. I began a Ph.D. program in Education, and my husband won an international nursing award. Conversely, I also lost family members, lost friends, and chose to step away from graduate school entirely this past year. As with the balance between dark and light, the lows must exist for the highs to emerge.</p>
                        <p>I ended 2021 in choosing to prioritize my mental health for what feels like the millionth time in my life. No matter how many times I make this decision, the choice never seems to get easier. It's hard to walk away from the things you've worked so hard for, especially when you think you're on the right path to accomplishing all you've set out to accomplish. However, if there is anything that 2021 taught me, it is that the right people never walk away from you, and you never walk away from the situations that are right for you. What's interesting, though, is that sometimes the right people for you are hidden in a place that is not right for you but may still be right for them. I know that is a complicated sentence, but I encourage you to hold on to it until it makes sense, if it doesn't already.</p>
                        <p>Through any experience, high or low, I had the pleasure of growing alongside my husband, who never ceases to amaze me with the genuine strength, care, respect, and compassion he shows towards anyone he meets. I am indescribably grateful for the love and support he has shown me as I've fought the all too familiar mental health battle this year. So, going into 2022, I intend to utilize the grace my husband has shown me to continue learning about myself and who I want to be. That adventure starts with a first step that I'm incredibly excited about: moving back home to Alabama.</p>
                        <p>I'll be posting here as a sort of log for the new highs and lows I encounter, sharing my experiences and thoughts on life while I figure out what it means to live and learn outside of the traditional education setting. With that, I want to add a disclaimer that I've decided to make things up as I go. My lengthier, more "philosophical" posts will be tagged "Two Cents," and, as some call me Spoon, I'll refer to the various lessons I discover as "spoons" and number them accordingly. Along with spoons, I'll (most likely) include music recommendations in my Two Cents because there is always a song relevant to how you're feeling.</p>
                        <p>I'll go ahead and jump into the first spoon of 2022, so I don't waste any time.</p>

                        <p>The beauty of unconditional love lies in the ability to lean on the infinite when you feel trapped by the finite.</p>
