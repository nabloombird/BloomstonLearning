                        <p>Just like that, the reality of change rears its head once again.</p>
                        <p>Since I've already shared my thoughts on the new year, today feels like a good day to share my thoughts on Christmas and other holidays. Growing up, I remember Christmas feeling busy; we'd open presents, go to mass, go to my grandmother's house, and get home late that night. As I got older, we all started to move around, either living on separate ends or in an entirely different state. Holidays felt less busy then, more fitting to the dynamic of my immediate family. We've always enjoyed having things to do ("we," being my parents, sister, and I), but we tend to thrive in the sweet spot right below busy and just above bored. With just us, we'd get up, open presents, my dad would make pancakes and coffee, then we'd go our separate ways to explore our new gadgets. Not long after, we'd be all together again, just hanging out like we always do. Sure, we spent Christmas Eve watching Scrooged, The Muppets Christmas Carol, Emmett Otter's Jugband Christmas, and A Christmas Carol; there were presents under a tree, meant to be opened the next day, but Christmas, in my family, was like any other day.</p>
                        <p>As a family, something we've always appreciated is the power of quality time. For hours, we can sit without speaking a single word to each other, just enjoying each other's company as we go about our respective thoughts. Just as well, we can sit together at the dinner table, carrying on a conversation about this, that, and the other, until we realize it's late enough to go to bed. I don't think I realized how powerful such a family dynamic could be until I left for college.</p>
                        <p>When I was a freshman in undergrad at Auburn University, I worked at the vet school and, unfortunately, needed to work Christmas. As a result, we had our Christmas early, all of us gathering in my apartment to watch our movies. But, I spent the actual day of December 25th partially alone, partially with my boss and a few newborn puppies. I learned then that the experience of family and unconditional love that others long for holidays to feel is something that I was fortunate to have every day of the year. I often forget that I've ever spent any holiday alone because of that; I'm incredibly grateful.</p>
                        <p>This Christmas has played out similarly, except Christmas 2021 still hasn't happened yet for my family. My husband, a nurse, was scheduled over Christmas, and, due to winter weather events, my parents weren't able to visit as planned. We adapted our holiday plans for the following weekend, which would span the New Year, but winter weather thwarted those plans yet again. While, at this current point in time, I am still watching the weather and road conditions closely in hopes of an opportunity to have a short visit, I can't help but be thankful for my past experiences. It can be challenging to face a holiday without the family members you expect to spend time with, but all that means is the time we have to spend with them is even more valuable. I feel sad that I haven't gotten to hug my mom and dad yet, and that I haven't been able to give the dog his Christmas present; to say otherwise would be lying. It's just that I know I'll hang out with them soon, and we'll have our Christmas then, so it makes it easier to adapt to change.</p>
                        <p>Holidays are significant; I won't downplay that. I love the feeling of holiday times, with decorations and lights providing a visual display of the joy fluttering about. What I'm writing about, and what I think I'll make a spoon about, is that I just realized every day has that holiday feel with the love and support I receive from my family. If that sounds cheesy, good; if that sounds like I'm bragging, that was the plan. I'm proud and honored to have the family that I do, so, yeah, I'm going to brag about them.</p>
                        <p>But what is my point in all of this? The family I speak of today looks different from the family I spent holidays with as a kid. We've grown, we've moved, some are on their own path right now, others have found their way to us to join our family. The circle of community, love, and support that we surround ourselves with and call family is something we choose ourselves. Through every dark time I've faced, my family has been right behind me as the light I need to guide me. With a brain like mine, that's a pretty cool thing to have.</p>
                        <p>Everything that I've learned from my experiences and my family about family has enabled me to live by today's very special spoon.</p>
                        <h3 class="subheading">Spoon #2:</h3>
                        <p><i>Every day can have the holiday feel when you create space in your heart for the family who might not realize their place is open to them</i></p>
                        <p>Whenever I feel like quitting, family reminds me why I'm not a quitter. To stay with something that you outgrow only leads to stagnation and decay. We can only grow where our roots can find nutrients. We do not quit; we leave with the soil that is no longer fertile.</p>
                        <p>If this post didn't feel like a mess, surprise, it was written for you.</p>
