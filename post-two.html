                        <p><i>Content Areas:</i> 3D creations<br><i>Grade Levels:</i> Upper Secondary School - On</br></p>
                        <p>Blender is a free and open source 3D creation platform that enables exploration into the world of 3D modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, and video editing, as well as 2D animation. The power of such a tool offers a wide range of application but the most notable may be the opportunity for students to visualize and communicate valuable learning concepts. In many cases, and especially in STEM classes, students may encounter concepts that are abstract or invisible to the naked eye and is incredibly challenging, if not impossible, to observe. The use of a 3D creation platform opens the door for students to develop meaningful connections between the content they're learning and how they understand a given concept. The ability to see that which is typically unseen has the potential to create meaning where observeration had previously been technologically limited. Blender also offers methods of testing ideas and hypotheses, such that students can embrace their natural curiosity and create 3D models to visualize the question for which they seek the answer.</p>
