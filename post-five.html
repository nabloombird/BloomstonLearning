                        <h2 class=”section-heading” style="text-align:left">What a busy week.</h2>
                        <p>The last few days have been the busiest feeling days I've had in a while, leaving me with interestingly conflicting emotions. While I had intended to write another Two Cents this week (before this), I spent that time rediscovering the type of "busy" I enjoy being and reminding myself of why I'm taking this new approach to life. With this route, there is no timeframe to which I must adhere. Before this week, I never realized how quickly deadlines and due dates could damn creativity to a place of haste and impulsivity. While I've spent this week discussing new ventures and projects ideas, I've spent the time between conversations playing Animal Crossing/Stardew Valley and exploring new topics I didn't have the opportunity to learn about while still in school. So far, working as my employer has been incredibly liberating, despite feeling daunting at the same time. What I didn't expect, however, is just how final such a change in trajectory would feel. That's what this post is about, so buckle up; this one is a rollercoaster.</p>
                        <p>I knew that deciding to leave graduate school was choosing to walk away from everything I had worked so hard to achieve. Except, I also knew that what I was leaving behind was only the achievements I had sought relative to academia. No matter what I chose to leave behind, I decided that the time I had already missed back home with my family was more than enough cost to outweigh the benefit of a degree I was seeking for fun. There are issues that I aim to address and problems for which I intend to find solutions; however, I realized the path I was walking was not the way to create the change I am seeking to make.</p>
                        <p>A few years ago, a dear friend shared some much-needed wisdom: plans are useless, planning is essential. I've held those words close ever since, following them as a beacon of hope to guide me to my next steps whenever something goes wrong. In the last seven months, I've watched something grow behind his eyes. I've felt something going wrong, something that has cast a shadow over what he wishes would go unseen. No amount of planning has felt as though it was the essential key necessary to aid in unlocking whatever it is that plagues him so.</p>
                        <p>I knew from the beginning, seven months ago, that I could only help as much as he allowed, so I followed his lead. Unfortunately, a critical error occurred along the way. Our communication seemed to deflate back to its original state of uncertainty at the beginning of our knowing each other while still feeling comfortable and secure. It felt as though eggshells suddenly appeared amongst the stability of our dynamic, creating a sense of there being two different versions of the same person.</p>
                        <p>I walked away when I did because I could feel the pieces of my friend that I knew to be true slipping away into the depths of the shadows I had seen growing. At that point, I realized a few things: 1.) I didn't want the memories I have with my friend to be tarnished by external forces negatively influencing my perception of him, 2.) I didn't want to encourage self-destructive behaviors, and 3.) I'm terrified of unintentionally becoming him.</p>
                        <p>Okay. Bear with me. Early on, my dad taught me to pursue a career that didn't feel like work, as he has always felt like he was cleaning his room for eight hours every day throughout his working life. I spoke with him the other day, and he explained that he'd be taking 40% of another person's workload because that person had recently left the company. After discussing the imbalance of taking 40% of someone else's responsibilities on top of your own without compensation of increased pay for an increased workload, I had an insane "a-ha" moment. My friend has been making the same variety of decisions my dad had made that ultimately resulted in points of friction in our family dynamic. In that conversation with my dad, I realized that I was terrified of sacrificing my life to maintain a career that felt restrictive, unsatisfying, or incomplete. The question, then, became, "how do I create the change I dream of if I destroy myself in the process? What message does that send?"</p>
                        <p>I left because I refused to allow something I'd chosen to pursue to tear down the stable ground on which I had built myself. I will not embrace self-sacrifice to enable others to flourish when struggling to survive.</p>
                        <p>So, yeah. What I didn't expect was how final my leaving would feel for our friendship.</p>
                        <p>It can be wild to be me, and I know it can be quite the experience to know me. I tend to see, hear, and be aware of things that most people wouldn't expect me to, and I certainly don't blame them. All I can hope is that people understand everything I do is intentional. By leaving, I intentionally removed myself from that which prevented me from providing what I have to offer. Taking the steps towards myself has opened the door to perceiving the stress of being busy as organic excitement again.</p>

                        <p>p.s. I'm still here.</p>
