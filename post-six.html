                        <p><b><i>Statement in question:</i> "People bore me."</b></p>
                        <p>As an outsider, simply observing the world around me, I find people are fascinating. To me, you can learn a great deal about any individual by acting as only a spectator while they meander through life and tend to their day-to-day activities. Through observing many individuals, you can gain great insight into the behaviors of any future person with whom you may interact. A rule of thumb in statistics is that the greater the sample size, the more accurate the results are to the population whence the sample originated. The same can apply to people-watching, whether you put your findings on a spreadsheet or not.</p>
                        <p>My entire life, I have found great enjoyment in learning about the people around me, as many would agree, I'm sure. However, when it comes to the majority of the population, I would prefer to observe than interact, as, again, people tend to bore me. What do I mean by that, though? How do people bore me? To put it plainly (and possibly rudely), I don't care about the "what's" of your life; I care about the "why's." Don't just tell me what your job is; tell me why you're doing that job. Why is football or baseball your favorite sport? What about that sport makes it your favorite sport? Do you like franchises like Star Wars and Star Trek for the futuristic, fantasy/sci-fi element or because you deeply ponder space and the existence of other beings beyond us? Most people don't care to discuss such topics until you've gained their friendship; I am the opposite. In my mind, the ability to talk about many different things, from the sentimental value of your favorite sport to the unfathomable nature of eight-dimensional numbers, from the beginning is an indicator of a potential friendship.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, as you may guess, it is a challenging way to go about life, essentially screening people for interest. Though, if there is anything my grandfather has taught me, it is that following the route that leads to your joy ultimately guides you to those with whom you match. Now, we ask the question, "what brings me joy? How will I know when I've found those who think in a way that complements my own?" I've thought about that question and have come to realize that, often, the things that bring us the most joy are the last things we'd think to put on a list (spoon spoiler).</p>
                        <p>I'll go first.</p>
                        <p>I find joy in aimlessly driving with no intention of stopping until it feels right; music playing probably too loud, only turning down the volume to discuss a random thought that's been toiling around in your brain for the last five songs. I want to have conversations about everything we've learned, the experiences we've had, and the opportunities we haven't taken or discovered yet.</p>
                        <p>Do you believe in God? A god? Multiple gods? What are your thoughts on tarot and other esoteric magic? Do you find beauty in the parallelism and symmetry of alchemy and modern sciences? What about the Monster Group? Do you think it could be the voice of a god, as its discoverers posit? I want to hear about the sounds that move you, the things that scare you, the things that terrify you into learning more about them. Being vulnerable can lead to pain, yes, but being guarded at all times can blind you from love.</p>
                        In no way am I suggesting to allow yourself to live in a vulnerable state; I am a firm believer in creating personal boundaries and adhering to them. I am encouraging you to consider the possibility that you have everything you need to enable yourself to recognize when it is worth it to open your heart. The most common indicator of this might make you lean back and go, "holy shit," because, most likely, you've known someone worth that risk all along.</p>
                        <p>The most common indicator is: they talk with you.</p>
                        <p>Crazy, right? Communication, meaningful communication, is so valuable to humans, as a species, that we can be so concerned about having many different people to converse with, we fail to recognize the wealth stored in a single conversation with one individual. Those times when you keep talking and can't stop? When you follow their story with one of your own with a similar perspective? Those are the conversation and the people I am speaking of; they are the people who talk with you.</p>
                        <p>So, say it with me, "I will no longer invest my time in those who talk at me; I will invest in those that talk with me." Who knows, you may find your whole world gets flipped, turned upside-down when you invest in those who are worth the investment. Remember, you know who is or isn't worth it, so trust yourself.</p>
