                        <p>I believe that the use of technology in education provides students with the opportunity to develop a deeper connection with the experience of learning. As technology advances, the ways in which students can actively engage with their learning have evolved to create educational environments that are more involved and immersive.</p>
                        <p>This evolution, and subsequent utilization, of educational technology has enabled students to participate in more in-depth and meaningful activities, offering aid in learning foundational concepts. I believe that the importance of developing a sound foundation on which to build an understanding of more complex concepts is not to be undervalued.</p>
                        <p>Thus, my research involves assessing methods of using educational technology (specifically, Socially mediated Augmented Reality lessons) to facilitate students’ learning, retention, and application of fundamental STEM concepts. The goal for my research is to improve students’ understanding of micro-scale phenomena and associated spatial and mathematical representations through collaborative AR learning environments.</p>
                        <h2 class=”section-heading” style="text-align:left">Educational Technology: A Tool to Extend the Reach of Education</h2>
                        <p>I believe that the use of technology in education provides an opportunity to extend the reach of education beyond the bounds of classroom walls. Educational technology offers the unique ability to close the distance in “distance education” by creating virtual learning spaces for social engagement.</p>
                        <p>In addition to assessing ways to improve student understanding, I am interested in how students learn in socially mediated, dynamic, and user-controlled lessons that explore molecular-scale processes. Such insights into social learning in a localized virtual environment opens the door to distanced virtual environments, without compromising the valuable aspect of collaboration.</p>
                        <p>I believe that investing in a future for technology in education will give rise to providing educational resources where they may otherwise never be accessible. In this way, I believe education can be made a shared resource available to anyone, regardless of background, status, or location.</p>
